# Count the number of Duplicates
#
# Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphanumeric characters, including digits, uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
#
# Example
#
# "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
# "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "aabbcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
# "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
# "aa11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'

# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.

require 'pry'

# Description
#
# Middle Earth is about to go to war. The forces of good will have many battles with the forces of evil. Different races will certainly be involved. Each race has a certain 'worth' when battling against others. On the side of good we have the following races, with their associated worth:
#
# Hobbits - 1
# Men - 2
# Elves - 3
# Dwarves - 3
# Eagles - 4
# Wizards - 10
# On the side of evil we have:
#
# Orcs - 1
# Men - 2
# Wargs - 2
# Goblins - 2
# Uruk Hai - 3
# Trolls - 5
# Wizards - 10
# Although weather, location, supplies and valor play a part in any battle, if you add up the worth of the side of good and compare it with the worth of the side of evil, the side with the larger worth will tend to win.
#
# Thus, given the count of each of the races on the side of good, followed by the count of each of the races on the side of evil, determine which side wins.
#
# Input:
#
# The function will be given two parameters. Each parameter will be a string separated by a single space. Each string will contain the count of each race on the side of good and evil.
#
# The first parameter will contain the count of each race on the side of good in the following order:
#
# Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves, Eagles, Wizards.
# The second parameter will contain the count of each race on the side of evil in the following order:
#
# Orcs, Men, Wargs, Goblins, Uruk Hai, Trolls, Wizards.
# All values are non-negative integers. The resulting sum of the worth for each side will not exceed the limit of a 32-bit integer.
#
# Output:
#
# Return ""Battle Result: Good triumphs over Evil" if good wins, "Battle Result: Evil eradicates all trace of Good" if evil wins, or "Battle Result: No victor on this battle field" if it ends in a tie.

# You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

#first solution
def isValidWalk(walk)
  if walk.length == 10 && walk.count('n') == walk.count('s') && walk.count('e') == walk.count('w')
    return true
  else
    return false
  end
end

#refactored solution
def isValidWalk(walk)
  walk.length == 10 && walk.count('n') == walk.count('s') && walk.count('e') == walk.count('w')
end


# Trolls are attacking your comment section!
#
# A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
#
# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
#
# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

#first solution
def disemvowel(str)
  array = str.chars
  array.each_with_index do |char, i|
    if "aeiouAEIOU".include?(char)
      array[i] =  nil
    end
  end

  new_string = array.join
  return new_string
end

#more elegant solution
def disemvowel(str)
  str.delete('aeiouAEIOU')

# Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
#
# As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(
#
# So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1,1,1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
#
# [1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,...]
# But what if we started with [0,0,1] as a signature? As starting with [0,1] instead of [1,1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
#
# [0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,...]
# Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
#
# Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n==0, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)
#
# If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

def tribonacci(signature,n)
  for i in 3..n
    signature[i] = signature[i-1] + signature[i-2] + signature[i-3]
  end
  return signature.slice(0, n)
end


# Count the number of Duplicates
#
# Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphanumeric characters, including digits, uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
#
# Example
#
# "abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
# "aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "aabbcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
# "indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
# "Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
# "aa11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
